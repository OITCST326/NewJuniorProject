Trackable Console WCF Client ReadMe

This is a client Console application which uses a channel
factory to communicate with a WCF service. It references the
Client.Entities project uses the the TrackableEntities.Client
NuGet package to perform change-tracking on the client without
any knowledge of how the service will persist changes.

The client project includes copies of the service contracts.
Operation contract names must match the service operation
names, although the method names each have the Async suffix.
In a console client, we simply get the task Result property
so that the main thread waits for the operation to complete.
In a GUI client, we would instead use async/await.

To start change-tracking, a ChangeTrackingCollection<T> is
created, passing one or more entities to the constructor.
Inserts, updates and deletes are automatically tracked.
Calling GetChanges returns only the items that have been
modified, which can then be passes to the service Update
operation, where all changes are persisted in one round trip
and in a single transaction.
