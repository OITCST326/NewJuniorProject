Trackable Service Entities ReadMe

NOTE: You must first install the Entity Framework Power Tools.

This project template functions as a Data Access Layer and can be
referenced either by a Repositories class library or directly by
an ASP.NET Web API or WCF project.

Custom T4 templates are provided for reverse engineering a 
database to generate CodeFirst classes with a DbContext-derived
class and mapping classes that use a fluent API with entities
that implement the ITrackable interface from the TrackingEntitites
NuGet packages.

To get started, just right-click on the project produced by the
template, select Entity Framework, Reverse Engineer Code First.
Set the server name (for example, .\sqlexpress) and choose a
database.  The tool will generate all the CodeFirst classes based
on the T4 templates located in the project.

After running the tool, you will need to copy the connection string
from App.config into the web.config (or app.config) file of the
service host.
